# CubeTimePlotter

<b>Disclaimer:</b>

This project is ENTIRELY NICHE! The code is meant for one specific purpose, and takes input in one specific way. There is NO scalability to this project, and none is intended. Now stop judging my fantastic code!

<b>Purpose:</b>

The Android App called Speedcube Timer exports your records to a .csv file. This script compiles the times, and outputs a graph of all times and averages to plot.ly.

This is entirely for my own benefit and curiosity, and the code is therefore woefully esoteric.

<b>Do not use this project to judge my programming prowess, please!</b>
